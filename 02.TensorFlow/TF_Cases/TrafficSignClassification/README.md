Download and expand the training and validation datasets here. Go to http://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/ and download the training and test data. There is a lot of datasets on that page, but you only need the two files listed under **BelgiumTS for Classification (cropped images)**":	

* BelgiumTSC_Training (171.3MBytes)
* BelgiumTSC_Testing (76.5MBytes)

After downloading and expanding the files, your directory structure should look something like this:

```
/traffic/datasets/BelgiumTS/Training/
/traffic/datasets/BelgiumTS/Testing/
```
