    "The KMP matching algorithm uses degenerating property (pattern having same sub-patterns appearing more than once in the pattern) of the pattern and improves the worst case complexity to O(n).\n",

    "We take advantage of this information to avoid matching the characters that we know will anyway match. Let us consider below example to understand this.\n",
