    "In the analysis of algorithms, the master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences provides an asymptotic analysis (using Big O notation) for recurrence relations of types that occur in the analysis of many divide and conquer algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "The approach was first presented by Jon Bentley, Dorothea Haken, and James B. Saxe in 1980, where it was described as a \"unifying method\" for solving such recurrences. The name \"master theorem\" was popularized by the widely used algorithms textbook Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "procedure p( input x of size n ):\n",
    "    if n < some constant k:\n",
    "        Solve x directly without recursion\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        Create a subproblems of x, each having size n/b\n",
    "        Call procedure p recursively on each subproblem\n",
    "        Combine the results from the subproblems\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above algorithm divides the problem into a number of subproblems recursively, each subproblem being of size n/b. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its solution tree has a node for each recursive call, with the children of that node being the other calls made from that call. The leaves of the tree are the base cases of the recursion, the subproblems (of size less than k) that do not recurse. \n",

    "\n",
    "The above example would have a child nodes at each non-leaf node. Each node does an amount of work that corresponds to the size of the sub problem n passed to that instance of the recursive call and given by $f(n)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The total amount of work done by the entire algorithm is the sum of the work performed by all the nodes in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The runtime of an algorithm such as the 'p' above on an input of size 'n', usually denoted $T(n)$, can be expressed by the recurrence relation\n",

    "\n",
    "This equation can be successively substituted into itself and expanded to obtain an expression for the total amount of work done.\n",
    "\n",
