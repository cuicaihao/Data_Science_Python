    "# A ~5 minute guide to Numba\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba is a just-in-time compiler for Python that works best on code that uses NumPy arrays and functions, and loops. The most common way to use Numba is through its collection of decorators that can be applied to your functions to instruct Numba to compile them. When a call is made to a Numba-decorated function it is compiled to machine code “just-in-time” for execution and all or part of your code can subsequently run at native machine code speed!\n",

    "Out of the box Numba works with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- OS: Windows (32 and 64 bit), OSX, Linux (32 and 64 bit). Unofficial support on *BSD.\n",
    "- Architecture: x86, x86_64, ppc64le, armv7l, armv8l (aarch64). Unofficial support on M1/Arm64.\n",
    "- GPUs: Nvidia CUDA.\n",
    "- CPython\n",
    "- NumPy 1.17 - latest\n",

In these examples we’ll apply the most fundamental of Numba’s JIT decorators, @jit, to try and speed up some functions to demonstrate what works well and what does not.\n",

If it is called again with the same types, it can reuse the cached version instead of having to compile again.\n",
