    "# Python 3 Quick Tip: The easy way to deal with file paths on Windows, Mac and Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "One of programming’s little annoyances is that Microsoft Windows uses a backslash character between folder names while almost every other computer uses a forward slash:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Windows filenames:\n",
    "C:\\some_folder\\some_file.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "Most other operating systems:\n",
    "/some_folder/some_file.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an accident of early 1980’s computer history. The first version of MS-DOS used the forward slash character for specifying command-line options. When Microsoft added support for folders in MS-DOS 2.0, the forward slash character was already taken so they used a backslash instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thirty-five years later, we are still stuck with this incompatibility.\n",
    "If you want your Python code to work on both Windows and Mac/Linux, you’ll need to deal with these kinds of platform-specific issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, Python 3 has a new module called `pathlib` that makes working with files nearly painless.\n",
