    "One of programming’s little annoyances is that Microsoft Windows uses a backslash character between folder names while almost every other computer uses a forward slash:\n",

    "This is an accident of early 1980’s computer history. The first version of MS-DOS used the forward slash character for specifying command-line options. When Microsoft added support for folders in MS-DOS 2.0, the forward slash character was already taken so they used a backslash instead. \n",
